There must be excel-file/s of people which you want to scan.

Example: if you have 1 group of students, you need to create excel-file with full names (Only russian language)
with numbering in the first column, so you will have the first row like this: | 1 || Иванов Иван Иванович |.
But do not forget to use those rules when you write full names:

--- RULES ---
- The last names and second names, in lists (ColledgeGroups) and in Excel-files with lists of people,
must end on 'й' or 'ё' (if name ends on 'и' then replace it to 'й').
- All letters 'й' and 'ё', in lists (ColledgeGroups) and in Excel-files with lists of people,
must be replaced on 'и' or 'е' if they are everywhere except the last letter. For example,
the last name 'Зулёхайрий' must be written like 'Зулехаирий'.
